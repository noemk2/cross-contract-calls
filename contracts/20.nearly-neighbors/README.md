# Nearly Neighbors

This is an family of contracts that let's you make proposals for new stuff happening near you.

Contracts

- factory
- proposal

## TODOs

- [ ] @amgando Figure out params & return types for simulation tests
- [ ] @tannerwelsh Wireframes for dApp UI
    - log in w/ near
    - create proposal
    - configure proposal
    - proposal view/status page
    - project list / map
    - project view page
- [ ] Build out factory contract + tests
- [ ] Build out proposal contract + tests
- [ ] Build out project contract + test

### Reqs for README

Work for @tannerwelsh

- [ ] Put in basic template features for a template
- [ ] Include screenshots for design (pick 2 or 3 to triangulate)

- [ ] 10,000 ft view of the project idea: kinda like kickstarter, serving needs for crowdsourced civic improvement
- [ ] Show 2-level tree view, identify what each folder is for; contextualize w/ a little bit of text (working family of contracts, each is unit tested, interactions between are simulation tested)
- [ ] Enumerate the contracts (factory, project, proposal), identify that one could use something like sputnik DAO to handle f
- [ ] Add referral to resources for deploying
- [ ] What, why, how do I work with this, how do I contribute 
- [ ] Ideas for further development (heatmaps, notifications, geocoords, algorithm for finding ideal location)
- [ ] Key contributors list

### Reqs for GH Pages

- [ ] Turn README into single page site
- [ ] Apply basic NEAR styles

### Reqs for writeup

- [ ] 1500-2000 words
- [ ] Narrative point 1: we are at a point where the time it takes to build a system that we can trust with our identity and our money is on par with the time it takes to build a form/landing page. This is the mind-bending realization - you can code and ship something in a matter of hours.
- [ ] Narrative point 2: we have come up with a reasonable work product that we can challenge developers in the community to take on, and reward them. Measures of success: working contract (or family of contracts), unit/simulation tested, UI/UX outlined/wireframed.
- [ ] Narrative point 3: beneficiaries of this are: entrepreneurs looking for an idea, hackathon participants who want a solid foundation (any competent web dev can deploy a working version of one of these projects), general community at large to converge around the best patterns.
- [ ] Does NOT need to include: what's in the repo, how to use it, etc.
- [ ] Should include from readme: screenshots of tests running, mockups, how to contribute, 10k ft view
